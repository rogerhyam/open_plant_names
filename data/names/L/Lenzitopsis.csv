In the new Vienna Code, Art. 37.1 states that after 1 Jan 1958, the type must be indicated.  However, Art. 37.2 states that for a species name, the requirement of 37.1  ""can be achieved by reference to an entire gathering . . . . even when it consists of two or more specimens.""""  That seems to me to cover the ambiguity of the typification of Lenzitopsis oxycedri"
